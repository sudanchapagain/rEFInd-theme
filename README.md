<h1 align="center"><i>rEFInd theme</i></h1>

This theme is just a mishmash of different things saved on GitHub for backup. Most of the icons are borrowed from the elementary rEFInd theme.

## Guide for me

- cd to /boot/EFI/refind
- append `include themes/crimson/theme.conf`
- move themes dir from this repo to current path
